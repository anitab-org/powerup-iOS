## General Guidelines
* In an active repository (not an archived one), choose an open issue from an from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  
* After approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.  
* If you have any questions, you can post them as a comment in your issue or in the project specific slack channel.
* Once you’ve fixed the issue, send us a pull request.
* Send all pull requests to the correct branch:  
  * Send Code pull requests to the develop branch.
  * Send Quality Assurance pull requests to the testing branch.
  * Send User Interface, Outreach, and Documentation pull requests to the non-coding branch.
## Opening a New Issue
* If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. 
*If you’ve determined that this issue doesn’t exist anywhere else.  Use the [issue template](https://github.com/systers/powerup-iOS/issues/new) to open a new issue.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.
* Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible.
## Important Reminders
* First, ask for approval.  Then, submit a Pull Request.  Once it’s approved, begin work on it.
* Only work on issues assigned to you.  You can ask to take over an issue if there are no comments in the last 3 days.
* Check the open and closed issues before you report an issue, to avoid duplication.
* Use the slack channel to suggest completely new developments, not in the issue list. Use issue list to suggest bugs/features in the already implemented sections.
## Communicate
The best way to connect with the maintainers is through GitHub comments. Feel free to discuss more about an issue by commenting on it or asking questions. We also have Systers Slack channel, you can request an invite [here](http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/). If there is something you want to discuss privately with the maintainer and you are being hesitant to discuss it on above mediums, then drop an email.

## Don’t Know Code?
We need your help too!  Look for these labels in the issues:
* Documentation: Documentation is a huge part of a successful open source project. Organizations need documentation to help attract users and new contributors.
* Research: An organization may need help crunching numbers or analyzing feedback to better understand what the users want or need.
* Outreach: Outreach is how open source projects attract new users and developers. This includes writing blog posts or making videos, organizing meetups, or helping others learn about the project.
* Training: Teach others how to use the project. This is a specialized form of outreach or documentation.
* User Interface: User interface can include many types of tasks including designing new visual aspects of a webpage or creating a new logo for the project. It may also include various accessibility opportunities to help make the project easier for people who are visually impaired.
* Quality Assurance: Finding and verifying bugs is an important part of software development.
* Other: If you have an idea that may help an organization, reach out to them and let them know! Sometimes the best task is one that the organization hasn’t even considered yet.
