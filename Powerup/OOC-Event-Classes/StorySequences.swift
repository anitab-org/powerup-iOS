// MARK: Scenario 5 - Home
// define each story sequence as a private let, named descriptively
// a StorySequence is a dictionary of StorySequenceStep, keys must be Int and serve to make the collection more readable as well as giving better access to starting a sequence in the middle
// a StorySequenceStep describes two StorySequenceEvent, a left event and a right event.
// A StorySequenceEvent describes the text, image, and image position.
// if any properties are left nil, there will be no change from the previous step
// you can nil the entire event as well (for no change from the previous step)
// calling .dismiss in the pos property hides *and* releases the image from the imageView
